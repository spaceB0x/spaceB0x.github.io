My name is Tyler Welton. In some parts of the internet I go by spaceB0x. I have been tinkering and with the insides of computers since I was young. My obsessive curiosity and youthful mischievousness evolved over many years into a career in information security. I currently have the privilege of working for a terrific software company Built Technologies, helping with all things security. I love helping organizations solve security problems, and aiding them to think like an adversary so that they can mitigate the adversary. Letâ€™s do something cool together.
